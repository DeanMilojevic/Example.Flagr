# Example.Flagr

The playground to experiment on how to use the Flagr.

## Dependencies

This example relies on the following dependencies:

* [Flagr](https://github.com/checkr/flagr)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## The implementation

This example only provides a simple sandbox for experimenting with features that `Flagr` offers. It is not meant to be an full flagged project. I will be adding examples on how to use the features of `Flagr` to echieve, for example A/B testing.

To use the Flagr UI, after running the `docker-compose` on the project, navigate to the `http://localhost:18000` (or if you modified the configuration files, to the port specified).
